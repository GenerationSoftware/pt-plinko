# pt-plinko

A web embed that simulates PoolTogether wins through a game of plinko. The outcome of the game will always match the wins that are passed to the web app. This is meant as a fun and intuitive way to check wins, but has no impact whatsoever on the outcome of the wins.

Additional user odds can be passed in to make the game reflect their actual odds more accurately.
